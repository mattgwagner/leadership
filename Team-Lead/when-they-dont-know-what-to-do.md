-- Context and Clarity! When people don't understand the how OR the why, people fall back to doing what they do know how to do.

“I don’t know where to jump in on Project X. You keep saying it’s the most important, but when I don’t know what to do – I do what I know.”

Silence… except for a few other nodding heads.

See, I’d mistaken “lack of context and clarity” for “lack of motivation.”
