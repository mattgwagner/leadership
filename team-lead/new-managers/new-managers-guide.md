New Managers: The Complete Guide \| Officevibe [https://www.officevibe.com/complete-guide-new-manager](https://www.officevibe.com/complete-guide-new-manager)

"Being a manager is about bringing out the best in people. That’s the bottom line. It’s a selfless, people-first, heart-driven role, and it’s worth every second of the complexity if you’re in it for the right reasons."

"Leadership - for better or for worse - directly affects the level of engagement and commitment an employee feels towards their organization. In fact, 75% of employees who quit their jobs, quit because of their manager."

"High-level responsibilities of a manager\*:

Develop, support, coach, motivate and reward employees.

Plan ahead and evaluate projects and tasks.

Define \(with employees\) clear roles and responsibilities.

Establish goals and performance standards.

Create a healthy work environment by implementing and maintaining work systems, policies and procedures.

Network and act as a liaison between employees and upper management."

"Help employees grow by letting them test, learn and fail without fear."
