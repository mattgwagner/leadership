"Now, it actually doesn't matter whether you actually have a formal retrospective. It doesn't matter whether you have four or five labels of things on your retro board, or exactly how you do the retro. What does matter is the notion of thinking about what we're doing and how we can do better, and it is the team that's doing the work that does this, that is the central thing."

"Allistair Cockburn's approach to agile was "come together in peace and harmony, deliver software every week, and do a retro every time to figure out how you can improve". "
