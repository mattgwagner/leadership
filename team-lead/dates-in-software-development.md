So your job, is to deal with the impossibility of taking something inherently chaotic, unknown and unpredictable and making it happen inside a structure of time and budget.
And the first important step is to acknowledge what you’re doing: you’re guiding a soup of instincts, craft, talent, personality, insight and sheer grind. It’s not predictable, but you have to predict it. That’s why Engineering Management is a difficult, highly paid job. If it was easy, it wouldn’t pay so much. You’re leading people. That means connecting with them, understanding them, motivating them and providing them with good reasons as to why they are doing what they’re doing. All this is tricky and takes experience and a desire to find the best in people.
And then second, you lean on the basic principles of project management, which, over time, have remained remarkably constant:

* Break it into pieces. Keep the pieces small. See where you are after each piece. Adjust.
* Match the work to the people you have. Give architecture to the architecturally inclined. Give bits that have to go fast to the speed freaks. Seems obvious, but, hey, all of this is obvious at some level.
* Do the hard parts first. Oh, human nature: “that’s probably difficult, we’ll do it when we have some momentum”. No. You will keep putting it off until times are squeezed and pressure is high and then it’ll bite you. Do it now.
* Shine light on the unknowns, remorselessly. “We don’t know” is a red flag, a blaring alarm. The unknown is your black grail, your shadow. Find it, dispense with hit. “We’ll find that out later!”. How much later? How? etc.
