Begin with the end in mind

I think it’s important to ask yourself these questions, probably in this order:

What outcome do I want?

How long am I willing to wait?

How much effort am I willing to invest?

Given my answers, is the outcome realistic?

How confident are you that this will yield the outcome you want?


SPECIFICALLY

First, I learned that the kindest thing I could have done was speak frankly with Jack as soon as I saw problems.

I still might have fired him, but it wouldn’t have come as a shock.

Second, I learned that once you’ve lost confidence in someone, it’s probably time to fire them.

You’ll probably use the PIP to “manage them out,” rather than using it to help them improve.

And if they do improve, you may still want to fire them, because you’re so over it.

So, it’s a bad situation for everyone.
