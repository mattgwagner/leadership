Questions to ask when someone is underperforming.

Ask these questions to look inward.
You’re trying to figure out: “How have I been letting this person down? How have I been getting in the way?”

- Is it clear what needs to get done? How can I make the goals or expectations clearer?
- Is the level of quality that’s required for this work clear? What examples or details can I provide to clarify the level of quality that’s needed?
-Am I being respectful of the amount of time you have to accomplish something? Can I be doing a better job of protecting your time?
- Do you feel you’re being set up to fail in any way? Are my expectations realistic? What am I asking that we should adjust so it’s more reasonable?
- Do you have the tools and resources to do your job well?
- Have I given you enough context about why this work is important, who the work is for, or any other information that is crucial to do your job well?
- What’s irked you or rubbed you the wrong way about my management style? Does my tone come off the wrong way? Do I follow-up too frequently with you, not giving you space to breathe?

Ask these questions to look outward.

You’re trying to figure out: “What on the employee’s end is limiting them? What choices or capabilities of their own are keeping them from the results you want to see?”

- How have you been feeling about your own performance lately? Where do you see opportunities to improve, if any?
- What are you most enjoying about the work you’re doing? What part of the work is inspiring, motivating, and energizing, if any?
- What part of the work do you feel stuck? What have you been trying the “crack the nut” on, but it feels like you’re banging your head?
- What part of the work is “meh”? What tasks have you feeling bored or ambivalent about?
- When’s the last time you got to talk to or connect with a customer who benefited from the work you did? Would you like more opportunities to do that, and should make that happen?
- Do you feel you’re playing to your strengths in your role? Where do you feel like there is a steep learning curve for you?
- Would you say you’re feeling optimistic, pessimistic or somewhere in the middle about the company’s future?
