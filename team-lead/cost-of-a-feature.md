Consider...

1. Opportunity cost across all disciplines
2. Cost to implement feature (engineering, UX, product)
3. Cost to implement incremental improvements (engineering, UX, product)
4. Cost to deliver feature (processing, storage, monitoring)
5. Cost to train people internally to sell the feature
6. Cost to train people internally to support the feature
7. Cost to market the feature to existing customers
8. Cost to market the feature to new customers
9. Coordination cost across all teams
10. Cost to document and train users/customers on new feature
11. Cost to maintain that extra documentation
12. Cost to train engineers on more complex code base
13. Cost of slower engineering, caused by increased system complexity and maintanenace
14. Cost to hire more resources to account for slower engineering.
15. Cost of reduced flexibility, caused by increased system complexity and maintenance
16. Cost of maintaining system usability as system broadens
17. ... until the feature reaches eng of life (unless you retire it)

ALL THE MEETINGS COORDINATING 1-16 ABOVE.
