General things that are important criteria for measuring in a software engineer:

- Coding to Spec - can the developer produce clean, maintainable code that meets acceptance criteria without multiple remediation cycles

- Code reviews - meaningful comments that show understanding of the business domain and technical nuances

- Debugging and troubleshooting complicated issues - nothing works the first time, they need to be able to figure out why

- Process improvements and thoughtfulness


Is this person receptive to feedback?
