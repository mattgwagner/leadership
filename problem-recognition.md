2. They begin looking for it and ask questions (curiosity). 
3. They gather data (processing). 
4. They share their feelings and findings to a few trusted colleagues (communicating). 
5. They define the problem (writing). 
6. They check their resources (evaluating). 
7. They make a decision (leading)."
