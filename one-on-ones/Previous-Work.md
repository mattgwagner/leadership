From Marcus Blankenship:

In your next 1:1 meeting, try asking this question:

“What past project or success would you love to build on if given a chance?”

This is a great way to understand what excites your developers.

It also helps you know them better and build a more motivating environment.

You might not be able to give them the opportunity right now, but you can keep your eyes open, or collaborate with them to find a way to work on it.
