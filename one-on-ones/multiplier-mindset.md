Being a multiplier (or in your case exponential) is a key mindset to have as a leader; you have the ability to improve the performance of everyone you manage. Your managers have the same potential. These questions to ask in one on ones with them will help explore the multiplier mindset with them.

1) What’s one thing we could do for you to help improve the performance of your team?
2) What’s the biggest thing preventing your team from getting more done, or done better?
3) How much time do you spend in meetings? Are there any you don’t feel you need to attend?
4) How much time are you spending on individual work? What about managing? (Are they investing enough in their team?)
5) If we had budget to get you any one thing for you to make you better at your job, what would you want?
6) If we had budget for any one thing for your team to be more effective, what would you want?
7) Am a available to support you when you need it? Why do you say that?
