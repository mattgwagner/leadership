● I think all companies need to answer 3 simple questions. I'd call them the why, the what
and the how.
○ So the why questions are the fundamental ones. Why do we exist? Why should
someone want to work here? Why should we come and go the extra mile and
care? That's about purpose.
○ The what questions are: what are my products and services? What are the target
customer segments I'm trying to serve? What is our business model? That's
strategy.
○ The how questions are: how are we going to behave? How are we going to
operate as an organization and as a team? How are we going to bring our
purpose and our culture to life? That's about culture.
○ And I would argue, great companies, highly successful companies have real
clarity in these 3 things.

● If [Company] disappeared, what would happen? Does [Company] have a reason to
exist?
● In which (single) area of life do you have the best taste?
○ Optional follow-up: Do you work in that area? Why or why not?

● Do management's capabilities fit with what the task is going to be for that company?
○ Don't get overly persuaded by one person. Typically the people that have risen to
the top are great at storytelling, extraordinarily persuasive, and believe what
they're saying.
○ When we invest we are trying to invest in what a company will be, not what it was
or what it is. There are no future facts. Form your own outlook separate from
what management tells you.

● What's been your biggest recent error of omission and did you make any changes, even
at the margin, to your process as a result of that error?
○ Either the stock you wish had sold, the stock you wish you had bought. And I ask
this instead of the error of commission because I find that everyone should be
able to talk about their mistakes, the stuff that I did that went wrong, but it's only
the really good managers who look and say, what didn't I do that could have
added value.

● Which functions in the business could you outsource if you really had to?
○ And the purpose of that is to understand where the value is really being
generated in the business, versus the ancillary activities that support that. That
[question’s] trying to understand what capability drives their competitive
advantage.

● How much time or money would be needed to copy your products or services?
● What are the three most important financial and nonfinancial KPIs (key performance
indicators) on your dashboard?
○ What does management think is critical to the business that drives value?
● When do you choose to build versus buy?
○ How do they make that decision of going to buy an asset versus go green field?
● What are common mistakes you've seen others make in the industry?
○ This would be to get a sense of not just how the industry works, but also what
management sees as a fatal flaw that they try to avoid—and whether they have a
good understanding of what can break the business side; the risk management
side of it.

● Sometimes it could be an innocuous, supposedly naive question—but [one] you can get
a lot out of. An example would be if a business has really high returns on capital, you
could ask, “well look, your returns on capital are really high. Why haven't they come
down? Everyone else in the industry doesn't do as well. What's the secret sauce?”
● Anything else I should have asked?
● Reminder: listen to the point of being uncomfortable with the silence.
