# Leadership

A collection of my links, notes, and templates for my different leadership roles.

Some of the content is taken verbatim, some as links, some as my musings. When in doubt, assume that nothing in here is original or should be quoted as such.



Disclaimer: These views do not represent the US Army, Department of Defense, or often times even my own, as they're quotes and snippets taken to provide insight on a particular situation or concept.
