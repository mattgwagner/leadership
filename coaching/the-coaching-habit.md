The Coaching Habit: Say Less, Ask More & Change the Way You Lead Forever by Michael Bungay Stanier

- What's on your mind?
- And what else?
- What's the real challenge here for you?
- What do you want?
- How can I help? (Blunt: What do you want from me?)
- If you are saying 'Yes' to this, what are you saying 'No' to?
- What was most useful here for you? What worked best here?

    What is our winning aspiration?
    Where will we play?
    How will we win?
    What capabilities must be in place?
    What management systems are required?

When people start talking to you about the challenge at hand, what’s essential to remember is that what they’re laying out for you is rarely the actual problem. And when you start jumping in to fix things, things go off the rails in three ways: you work on the wrong problem; you do the work your team should be doing; and the work doesn’t get done.
