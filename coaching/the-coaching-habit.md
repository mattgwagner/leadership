The Coaching Habit: Say Less, Ask More & Change the Way You Lead Forever by Michael Bungay Stanier

1 - What's on your mind?
2 - And what else?
3 - What's the real challenge here for you?
4 - What do you want?
5 - How can I help? (Blunt: What do you want from me?)
6 - If you are saying 'Yes' to this, what are you saying 'No' to?
7 - What was most useful here for you? What worked best here?

    What is our winning aspiration?
    Where will we play?
    How will we win?
    What capabilities must be in place?
    What management systems are required?
