- What are you OPTIMIZING for with this?

Turn it into a "even over" proposition, e.g. we're optimizing for speed even over quality.

Of the many questions I’ve tried out as part of this feedback method, my favorite question to ask is, “What are you optimizing for?”

I love this question. I’ve even started to use it as a routine part of my coaching calls. “What are you optimizing for?” doesn’t sound aggressive—it genuinely sounds curious. People have rarely put a lot of time into thinking about what they’re optimizing for, so often this question gives them an opportunity to sit back and really think about it.

And there’s no wrong answer! Some people are optimizing for speed and efficiency. Other people are optimizing for quality and thoroughness. Some folks are optimizing for doing lots of learning, or supporting their loved ones, or pushing themselves out of their comfort zone. The sky is truly the limit with this question.

And the best part? You might learn something new about this feedback recipient! Their answer to “What are you optimizing for?” might totally blow your mind, and reframe the entire context of their behavior, and your feedback. This is one of my favorite potential outcomes of the feedback equation: realizing that your feedback was based on an assumption you made, or a judgment you have, and that you need to take your own step back and do some introspection.
