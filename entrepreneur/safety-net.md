Guy Raz - How I Built This

At the risk of torturing this metaphor beyond recognition, what I’m
saying is that most of the successful entrepreneurs I’ve met left the
comfort of their previous lives as safely and smartly as possible. And
they did this in one of two ways: either they stayed in their “real jobs”
until their startups demanded more time than they could spare, or
they went for it with a fallback plan in their hip pocket, which made
the risks inherent in entrepreneurship manageable enough for them
to be able to sleep at night.
