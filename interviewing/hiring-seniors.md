Hiring seniors is especially difficult, as they are likely to want to bring the culture they are used to with them. They also have a lot of experience working their way, so it’s also likely they have a lot tougher time adjusting to a different environment. So, you better be extra careful; otherwise, you could end up breaking up your developer team, or going through a painful firing.

It’s unrealistic to expect seniors to have worked within the same culture you have, but you better make sure they are willing to buy in to your values at least, so they are likely to adapt. Have your values ready, explain to them what they are, how they translate to daily work, and see what your potential employee has to say.
