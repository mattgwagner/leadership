The organization of a Leader Book is up to the individual leader. The only real “rules” should be that it is well-organized, user friendly, and that it contains only essential training information. TC 7-22.7 does provide a “recommended” format that can be used for any type of unit (with minor modifications). 

Five sections, as follows: (TC 7-22.7, para 8.6.a)
SECTION 1: Administrative Soldier data
SECTION 2: Company METL/platoon supporting collective task list with assessments
SECTION 3: CTT profiency
SECTION 4: Essential Soldier task proficiency and status
SECTION 5: Unit collective task proficiency
