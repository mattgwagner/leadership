Dr Maxwell reviews chapters and notes from his book, the Leader's Greatest Return.

- Law of the Lid (from 21 Irrefutable Laws)

- Identifying Leaders - gotta find them to develop them! Your job as a leader is to get off the mountain and walk slowly through the crowd and look for the leader that you want on your team. And when you find them, your job is to take them up the mountain with you. And the key is you never climb the mountain alone. 

- Attracting Leaders. "Invite them to the leadership table". inside your company or organizawtion, invite people to be "exposed" to leadership, the conversations, the dialog, make a conscious effort of showing your developing leaders that it means.
