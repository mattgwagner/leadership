Here are some of my favorite questions to ask around uncovering someone’s work preferences:

Where on the spectrum of extrovert to introvert would you place yourself?

What’s your preferred way to receive feedback, in terms of format?

What’s your preferred way to receive feedback, in terms of speed?

What’s your orientation toward conflict?

What time of day are you most productive?

How would you describe your communication style?

What motivates you the most?

Who is your hero? Why?

What do you consider your “super power”?

Who’s been the best coworker / team you’ve worked with? Why?

Who’s been the best boss / mentor you’ve ever had? Why?

When have you worked with someone and noticed it not going well?

What do you think you’re more sensitive about, compared to others?

What’s your biggest work-related pet peeves (i.e., that thing other people do that totally annoys you when you work with them)?

What would others who’ve worked with you say are your greatest strengths?

What would others who’ve worked with you say are your greatest weaknesses?
