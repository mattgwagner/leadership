Michael Hyatt interviews Pat Quinn, a coach who helps executives and leaders have a greater impact with their speaking.

- Solid Content and Polished Delivery go hand-in-hand -- delivery without content makes you seem fake, but content without delivery limits the impact of your message.

- Pacing and Leading -- walking beside the person you're speaking to, you understand their problem and their pain, establish that understanding before you take them where you want them to go

- If you don't show empathy with your audience, the audience can feel like you don't GET them, that you don't have the same problems 

- Once you establish the pacing/empathy, you can show them how you can help solve their problems

- ORDINARY (show me you have the same problems, or else why are you the expert)
- EXTRAORDINARY (why would anyone listen to you if you haven't solved it)
- WHY (show me we're not just being sold to, that you care about the purpose behind the solution)
